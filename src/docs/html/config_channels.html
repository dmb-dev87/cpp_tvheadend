 <div>
  The channel tab is divided in three parts:
  <dl>
   <dt>The channel list (to the left)
   <dd>Use this list to select the channel you wish to work with.
       You can also drag a channel from this list onto the right side of
       the view to merge the dragged channel with the currently selected one.

   <dt>Channel details (right top)

       <dl>
        <dt>Channel name
	<dd>Name of the channel as presented in EPG and external interfaces.
            Changing name of a channel does not interfere with scheduled
            recordings etc.

        <dt>XML-TV Source
        <dd>Name of the XML-TV channel. If you have XML-TV enabled you can 
            select which XML-TV channel to obtain data from. By default 
            Tvheadend tries to match the name itself, but sometimes it might
	    not match between the XML-TV source and the TV provider so in
	    such cases you can change it yourself.

        <dt>Tags
	<dd>Each channel can be bound to a zero, one or many tags.
	    The tags are used for multiple things and it's up to you how
	    you wish to use and name them. Tags can be used to aid searching
	    in the EPG if you have many channels. The tags are also presented
	    in the Showtime Media player.
	    To (de-)select multiple tags, just hold the CTRL-button as with
	    any multi-selection list.

        <dt>Delete channel
	<dd>This button will delete the channel (and any scheduled recordings
	    tied to it). You will be asked to confirm before the actual
	    delete is executed, but after that, there is no way to recover.
       </dl>
   <dd>Changes to any of these settings must be confirmed by pressing the
       'Save configuration' button before taking effect. If you select
       a different channel any unsaved changes will be lost. It is, however,
       perfectly fine to switch Tab (if you want to check anything, create
       a new tag, etc) and come back without any changes being lost.


   <dt>Transports bound to channel (right bottom)
   <dd>In this view you can examine and enable/disable each of the transports
       bound to the channel. You may wish to disable a transport if it
       temporary out of service or in other terms problematic.
       The status of the enable checkbox is saved when the 'Save configuration'
       button is pressed.
