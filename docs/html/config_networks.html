		A network is the type of carrier for your television signals. Tvheadend supports several different types of network, notably:

		<dd>DVB-C : Cable TV, delivered via a cable to your house
		<dd>DVB-S : Satellite (includes S2), so any signal coming in via a dish
		<dd>DVB-T : Terrestrial, so over-the-air broadcasts received through a traditional television aerial
		<dd>ATSC : Over-the-air terrestrial, common in north and central America and parts of south Asia
		<dd>IPTV : IP, so over the Internet

		<dt>Skip initial Scan
