HTS "Home Theater System" is:
	
* An OpenGL based media player (''Showtime'')
* A TV distribution / recording headend (''Tvheadend'')
* Hosted at http://www.lonelycoder.com/hts
* A GPLed project
* Maintained by Andreas Öman (andreas at lonelycoder.com)


Build and Install
=================
The top level configure and Makefile will build both Tvheadend
and Showtime. However, Showtime will only be built if the
necessary dev packages for a few libs are installed.
