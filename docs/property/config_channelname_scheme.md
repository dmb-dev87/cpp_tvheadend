You must correctly set the *Channel icon path* (above) to be able to generate icon 
filenames. Note that changing this option **won't** automatically (re-)generate 
icon filenames. You must manually (re-)generate them using the 
*[Reset Icons]* button in the *Configuration -> Channel / EPG -> Channels* 
tab.
