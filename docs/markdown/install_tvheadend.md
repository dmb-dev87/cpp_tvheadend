##Install Tvheadend

This section tells you how to get hold of the software in the first place,
and how to get it onto your system.

###1. Install the Software

Follow the instructions that are specific to your Linux distribution
(Ubuntu/Debian/Mint, Arch, Fedora...). This will typically be PPA-and-dkpg
for Debian, but most other distros will need you to build your own version from source.

* [Debian/Ubuntu installation instructions](https://tvheadend.org/projects/tvheadend/wiki/AptRepository)

* [Instructions on how to build from source](https://tvheadend.org/projects/tvheadend/wiki/Building)

Do not assume that your distro's package manager will give you the latest
version of Tvheadend - indeed, give you any version at all. Always check.

Where a pre-built package exists, this will usually get you the last official
stable version. However, more advanced users may be interested in running
a development version - either a nightly build or a self-compiled version.
