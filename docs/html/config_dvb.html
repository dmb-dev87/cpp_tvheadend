 This tab is split in two panes. To the left is a tree which, at root level,
 contains all DVB adapters found by Tvheadend during startup.


 <dl>
  <dt>Step by step configuration of DVB
  <dd>
  The DVB configuration is perhaps the most tricky part to configure
  in Tvheadend. Therefore, this section begins with a step-by-step
  guide.
  <ul>
   <li>Click on an adapter in the left pane.
   <li>Click on 'Add mux(es)'. A popup window will appear:
   <br>
   <img src="docresources/muxbylocation.png">
   <br>
   For DVB-T and DVB-C adapters, expand appropriate country.
   DVB-S adapters only have one folder to expand called 'Geosynchronous Orbit'.
   In these folders you find a list of available networks.
   Select the appropriate network and press the 'Add' button.
   
   <li>
   Tvheadend will now immediately start to probe each mux for available
   services. Expand the DVB adapter in the tree 
   and wait until all muxes has been visisted
   at least once (Status of all multiplexes should change from 'Unknown' 
   when a mux has been visited).

   <li>
   You can now, if you want, verify that the mux scanner has found 
   services by expanding the mux nodes.

   <li>
   Select the adapters again and press 'Probe services'.
   A popup will ask you to confirm this action. Press 'Yes'.
   The Service probe will scan through all services on all muxes on the
   adapter and map them to channels with the corresponding name.
   Progress and result for each service is displayed in the 'System Log'
   at the bottom of the application. Wait until the probing is completed.
   <li>
   Done! You can click over to the 'Channels' configuration tab and 
   inspect all working channels.


  </ul>
  <dt>DVB Adapters
  <dd>
  A DVB adapter represents a piece of hardware attached to the system.
  DVB receivers with dual tuners will present themself as two adapters
  to the Tvheadend application. Tvheadend support DVB-T, DVB-C and DVB-S
  adapters.
  <p>
  When an adapter is selected, the right pane displays configurable items
  for the adapter. Also available in the right toolbar is a set of operations
  that can be performed on the adapter.
  <p>
  Underneath each adapter in the tree is a list of DVB muxes.
  For more information about muxes, see further down.
  <p>
  There is currently no way of adding a new adapter to Tvheadend when running.
  If a new adapter is plugged into the system Tvheadend needs to be restarted
  in order to detect it.
  <p>
  If Tvheadend has configuration for an adapter and the adapter is missing
  upon startup the configuration will be left untouched in case the adapter
  will be back in the future. There is currently no way to remove configuration
  for a no longer present adapter.
  <p>
  Warning: Unplugging an DVB adapter (USB, etc) during operation (i.e when
  Tvheadend is running) can result in deadlocking the kernel USB subsystem,
  most likely requiring a system restart.
  <p>
  Warning2: Suspending a system is (from a USB driver perspective) equivalent
  to a unplug/insert event. Thus, suspending a system running Tvheadend
  with USB adapters is not recommented at the moment.

  <dt>DVB Multiplexes
  <dd>
  To put it simply, a DVB multiplex is a digital signal modulated
  at a specific frequency that carries a number of servies (where a
  service could be, but is not limited to, a TV channel).
  <p>
  There are currently no operations that can be performed on a single mux.

  <dt>DVB Services
  <dd>
  A service is equivivalent to a TV channel.
  <p>
  There are currently no operations that can be performed on a single service.
