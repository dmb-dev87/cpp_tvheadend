Parts of this documentation is also available in the Tvheadend man page.
<p>
<dl>
 <dt>Starting Tvheadend
 <dd>
 If you already have Tvheadend up and running you can skip this part.
 <p>
 Command line options:
 <dl>
  <dt>-f
  <dd>
  Fork and become a background process (daemon). Default no.

  <dt>-u username
  <dd>
  Run as 'username'. Only applicable if daemonizing. Default is to
  use the uid of 1 (daemon on most systems).

  <dt>-g groupname
  <dd>
  Run as group 'groupname'. Only applicable if daemonizing. 
  Default is to use the 'video' group. 
  If the 'video' group does not exist, gid 1 (daemon) will be used.

  <dt>-s path
  <dd>
  Store settings in path. Default values varies depending on if
  daemonizing or not. See settings storage section below for details.
 </dl>


 <dt>Default configuration
 <dd>
 All configuration in Tvheadend is maintained via its embedded web
 server running on port 9981. Just point your browser to:
 <p>
 http://hostname:9981/
 <p>

 By default <b>everyone (also from remote hosts)is allowed full
 access to all features / settings</b> in the web user interface. If
 this is the first time you setup Tvheadend you are most encouraged to
 enter the web user interface, selected the 'Configuration' + 'Access Control'
 tab and make reasonable changes. Futher help / documentationcan be obtained
 inside the web interface.

 <dt>Settings storage
 <dd>
  Settings are stored in different locations depending on how Tvheadend
  was started.
  <p>
  If the (-s) argument is given, that path is always used.
  <p>
  Otherwise, tvheadend will try to store settings in <b>/var/lib/hts/tvheadend</b>.
  If this is not possible (due to access permission restriction) it will store
  it in the current user home directory under .hts/tvheadend.
  <p>
  If daemonizing, tvheadend will writes its running pid in /var/run/tvheadend.pid

 <dt>Logging
 <dd>
 All activity inside tvheadend is logged to syslog using log facility.
 Also, if logged in to the web interface you will receive the same log in the bottom
 tab (System log).


 <dt>Permission to access video adapters
 <dd>
 In order for Tvheadend to control video adapters on the system it
 must be granted access to those devices. Most systems have a 'video'
 group with write access to the video adapter devices. When Tvheadend
 is started as a daemon (if Tvheadend is installed from a distibution package
 this is most likely the way it is) it will change its primary group
 to 'video' in order to access these groups. If your system is configured
 in a different way you can either change the group membership of the
 video adapters (/dev/dvb, etc) or reconfigure the Tvheadend startup
 parameters.
 <p>
 If Tvheadend is started without the '-f' argument it will not daemonize
 nor change its primary userid/groupid. Rather it will run with the permissions
 granted to the user executing the binary. If that's the case you must make
 sure the current user is granted with access to the video devices.


 <dt>Open ports
 <dd>
 Tvheadend listens to the following TCP ports by default:
 <ul>
  <li>9981 - HTTP server (web interface)
  <li>9982 - HTSP server (Showtime protocol)
 </ul>
 There is currently no way of disabling these TCP servers, nor bind the services to
 specific interfaces or other ports.
 To limit access, please read the section about 'Access Control' 
 in the configuration chapter.


 <dt>Building Tvheadend from source
 <dd>
 If you want to build tvheadend from source, visit 
 <a href="http://trac.lonelycoder.com/hts/wiki/howtobuildhts">this</a> page.
 Please notice that wiki development site only reflects the work
 in 'trunk' (current development version).
  The instructions should not deviate much should you want to
 build a released version from source, but you never know.
