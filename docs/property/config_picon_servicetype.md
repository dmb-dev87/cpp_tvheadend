You must set the *Picon path* (above) to be able to correctly 
generate icon filenames. Note that changing this option **won't** 
automatically (re-)generate icon filenames, you must manually 
(re-)generate them using the *[Reset Icons]* button in the 
*Configuration -> Channel / EPG -> Channels* tab.

If your picon pack uses filenames that start with "1_0_1_xxxx" you'll want to 
use the *force service type to 1* setting. If your filenames use the 
standard naming scheme, e.g "1_0_19_xxxx" leave it as *Standard*.
