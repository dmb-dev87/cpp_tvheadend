hts-tvheadend (2.3) hts; urgency=low

  * Redesigned the DVB configuration tab in the web userinterface:
    - Each adapter have three (or four) tabs
      o General setup and information
      o Grid of multiplexes
      o Grid of services
      o For sattelite adapters, a sattelite configuration tab.

  * Add support for disabling / enabling an entire DVB multiplex

  * Add support for multiple DiSEqC switchports on a single adapter

  * Add support for different sattelite LNBs

  * Graceful handling of DVB adapters that does not support many
    table filters in hardware. Tvheadend will rotate among the available
    ones.

  * Add support for enabling / disabling transports from the DVB configuration

  * Make it possible to remove DVB multiplexes from the web ui

  * Add 'Revert changes' button to all editable grids in the web ui

  * Make it possible to disable the idle scan on per-DVB adapter basis.
    The idle scan is a process to cycles through all multiplex to check
    the quality for each mux continously.

  * Hopefully fix some rounding errors in the EPG display. Ticket #69

hts-tvheadend (2.2) hts; urgency=low

  * Set $HOME so forked processes (XMLTV) will have correct environment
    and to make the default storage of recorded videos to end up in the
    correct place.

  * Update built-in DVB mux presets to dvb-apps:1275:9655c8cfeed8

  * Add -h option to display usage.

  * Rewrite the internal streaming pipeline.
    This is not externally visible, but needed for a future timeshifter.

  * Make it compile on gcc 4.4

  * Send 'source' and 'network' information in HTSP.subscriptionStart message.

  * When deleting a channel any channel-bound autorecording would stay in
    memory and, sooner or later, cause a crash. This has now been fixed.

  * Add extra scan for XMLTV grabbers in $PATH. Apart from $PATH we also
    scan in /bin, /usr/bin, /usr/local/bin

  * Search for XMLTV grabbers in /usr/bin/perlbin/vendor (archlinux)

  * Fix a bug causing DVB card which does not implement the 
    FE_READ_UNCORRECTED_BLOCKS operation to report insane amount of
    forward correction errors.
