 The channels are listed / edited  in a grid. 

 <ul>
  <li>To edit a cell, double-click on it. After a cell is changed it
      will flags one of its corner to red to indicated that it has been
      changed. To commit these changes back to Tvheadend press the 
      'Save changes' button. In order to change a Checkbox cell you only
      have to click once in it.

  <li>To delete one or more entries, select the lines (by clicking once on 
      them), and press the 'Delete selected' button. A popup
      will ask you to confirm your request.
 </ul>

 <p>
 The columns have the following functions:

 <dl>
  <dt>Name
  <dd>Name of the channel as presented in EPG and external interfaces.
      Changing name of a channel does not interfere with scheduled
      recordings etc.

  <dt>XML-TV Source
  <dd>Name of the XML-TV channel. If you have XML-TV enabled you can 
      select which XML-TV channel to obtain data from. By default 
      Tvheadend tries to match the name itself, but sometimes it might
      not match between the XML-TV source and the TV provider so in
      such cases you can change it yourself.

  <dt>Tags
  <dd>Each channel can be bound to a zero, one or many tags.
      The tags are used for multiple things and it's up to you how
      you wish to use and name them. Tags can be used to aid searching
      in the EPG if you have many channels. The tags are also presented
      in a Media player.
