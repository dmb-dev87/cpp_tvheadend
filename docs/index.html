</center>

Tvheadend is part of the <b>HTS</b> project hosted at
<a href="http://hts.lonelycoder.com/">http://hts.lonelycoder.com/</a>
<p>
It functions primarily as a TV streaming backend for the Showtime Mediaplayer but
can be used standalone for other purposes, such as a Digital Video Recorder.

</div><div class="hts-doc-section">1.2 Install and initial setup</div>
<div class="hts-doc-text">
Parts of this documentation is also available in the Tvheadend man page.
<p>
<dl>
 <dt>Starting Tvheadend
 <dd>
 If you already have Tvheadend up and running you can skip this part.
 <p>
 Command line options:
 <dl>
  <dt>-f
  <dd>
  Fork and become a background process (deamon). Default no.

  <dt>-u userid
  <dd>
  Run as user with 'userid'. Only applicable if daemonizing. Default is to
  use the uid of 1 (daemon on most systems).

  <dt>-g groupid
  <dd>
  Run as user with 'groupid'. Only applicable if daemonizing. 
  Default is to use the gid for the 'video' group. 
  If the 'video' group does not exist, gid 1 (daemon) will be used.

  <dt>-s path
  <dd>
  Store settings in path. Default values varies depending on if
  daemonizing or not. See settings storage section below for details.
 </dl>


 <dt>Default configuration
 <dd>
 All configuration in Tvheadend is maintained via its embedded web
 server running on port 9981. Just point your browser to:
 <p>
 http://hostname:9981/
 <p>

 By default <b>everyone (also from remote hosts)is allowed full
 access to all features / settings</b> in the web user interface. If
 this is the first time you setup Tvheadend you are most encouraged to
 enter the web user interface, selected the 'Configuration' + 'Access Control'
 tab and make reasonable changes. Futher help / documentationcan be obtained
 inside the web interface.

 <dt>Settings storage
 <dd>
  Settings are stored in different locations depending on how Tvheadend
  was started.
  <p>
  If the (-s) argument is given, that path is always used.
  <p>
  Otherwise, tvheadend will try to store settings in <b>/var/lib/hts/tvheadend</b>.
  If this is not possible (due to access permission restriction) it will store
  it in the current user home directory under .hts/tvheadend.

 <dt>Logging
 <dd>
 All activity inside tvheadend is logged to syslog using log facility.
 Also, if logged in to the web interface you will receive the same log in the bottom
 tab (System log).


 <dt>Permission to access video adapters
 <dd>
 In order for Tvheadend to control video adapters on the system it
 must be granted access to those devices. Most systems have a 'video'
 group with write access to the video adapter devices. When Tvheadend
 is started as a daemon (if Tvheadend is installed from a distibution package
 this is most likely the way it is) it will automatcially change its primary group
 to 'video' in order to access these groups. If your system is configured
 in a different way you can either change the group membership of the
 video adapters (/dev/dvb, etc) or reconfigure the Tvheadend startup
 parameters.
 <p>
 If Tvheadend is started without the '-f' argument it will not daemonize
 nor change its primary userid/groupid. Rather it will run with the permissions
 granted to the user executing the binary. If that's the case you must make
 sure the current user is granted with access to the video devices.


 <dt>Open ports
 <dd>
 Tvheadend listens to the following TCP ports by default:
 <ul>
  <li>9981 - HTTP server (web interface)
  <li>9982 - HTSP server (Showtime protocol)
 </ul>
 There is currently no way of disabling these TCP servers, nor bind the services to
 specific interfaces or other ports.
 To limit access, please read the section about 'Access Control' 
 in the configuration chapter.


 <dt>Building Tvheadend from source
 <dd>
 If you want to build tvheadend from source, visit 
 <a href="http://trac.lonelycoder.com/hts/wiki/howtobuildhts">this</a> page.
 Please notice that wiki development site only reflects the work
 in HEAD (-current). The instructions should not deviate much should you want to
 build a released version from source, but you never know.
</dl>
</div>
<div class="hts-doc-section">1.3 Frequently Asked Questions</div>
<div class="hts-doc-text">

<dl>

 <dt>Why does Tvheadend deliver data over TCP to Showtime? I thought it was
     bad to use TCP for realtime sensitive traffic?

 <dd>
 'HTSP' - the protocol used for streaming TV, sending meta information
 updates and RPC between Tvheadend and Showtime uses a transmission
 scheduler with multiple queues on the Tvheadend side. This means that
 Tvheadend can measure the available bandwidth between itself and the
 mediaplayer and when congestion happens it's even capable of dropping
 less important data (such as B-frames). HTSP has been tested over WAN
 links and DSL connections with zero picture/audio artifacts.
 <p>
 It's possible to get view drop statistics and bitrates directly in
 Showtime.  (Open the menu when watching a TV-channel and switch on
 'Detailed Information')

</div>
<div class="hts-doc-chapter">2 Electronic Program Guide</div>
<div class="hts-doc-text">
Tvheadend has a built in Electronic Program Guide. The EPG is an in memory
database populated with all the information about events received from
the DVB networks or from XMLTV.
<p>
The EPG tab displays a filterable paged grid containing all the events
sorted based on start time.
<img src="docresources/epg.png">
<p>
<dl>
 <dt>Filtering (or searching)
 <dd>
 In the EPG top tool bar you can access four input fields.
 These are used to filter/search for events. The form uses implicit AND
 between the input fields. This means that all filters must match
 for an event to be displayed.
 <dl>
  <dt>[Search title...]
  <dd>
  Filter on the event title. The filter uses case insensitive regular
  expression. If you don't know what a regular expression is this means
  that you can type just parts of the title and filter on that too.
  (No need for exact matching).
  <dt>[Only include channel...]
  <dd>
  Only display events from the selected channel.
  <dt>[Only include tag...]
  <dd>
  Only display events from the channels which are included in the selected tag.
  Tags are used for grouping channels and is configured by the administrator.
  <dt>[Only include content...]
  <dd>
  Most DVB networks classify their events into content groups. This field
  allows you to filter based on content type.
 </dl>
 Thus, if you only would like to browse Movies from your HD-channels you
 would select 'HD channels' in the [Only include tag...]-field, and select
 'Movie / Drama' in the [Only include content...]-field.
 <p>
 Notice that you don't have to press a 'Search' button, the grid immediately
 updates itself as you change the filters.
 <p>
 If you would like to clear all filters, just press the [Reset] button.

 <dt>Paging

 <dd>
 In an installation with many (hundreds of) channels and full EPG feed from 
 both DVB and XMLTV there will be tens of thousands of events in the database.
 Therefore the EPG display employs a paging bar at the bottom of the grid.
 Use it to browse backwards and forwards in the EPG. It also displays the
 total amount of events matched by the current query.

 <dt>Event details and recording
 <dd>
 If you click on a single event, a popup will display detailed information
 about the event. It also allows the user to schedule the event for recording
 by clicking on the [Record program] button.
 <p>
 <img src="docresources/epg2.png">
 <p>
 To close the popup, just close it with the [X] window button.
 The popup is not modal and you can open as many detailed information popups
 as you want.


 <dt>Autorecordings
 <dd>
 Should you wish to record all events matching a specific query. (Record
 your favourite TV-show, etc) you can press the 'Create Autorec' button
 in the top toolbar.
 <p>
 A popup with details about the to-be-created autorecording rule needs to
 be confirmed before the rule takes effect.
 <p>
 <img src="docresources/autorecpopup.png">
 <p>
 The autorecordings can later be changed/deleted in under the
 'Digital Video Recorder'-tag. Use that editor if you temporary want
 to disable an autorecording or make adjustments, etc.
</dl>
</div>
<div class="hts-doc-chapter">3 Digital Video Recorder</div>
<div class="hts-doc-text">
Under the 'Digital Video Recorder' tab you can administer and list status of
individual recordings and configure rules for the automatic recorder.
<p>
To access the DVR tab you must be logged in sufficient access credentials.
<p>
For general configuration of the DVR (such as where and how to store the recordings,
please see the DVR section in the configuration chapter)
</div>
<div class="hts-doc-section">3.1 DVR Log</div>
<div class="hts-doc-text">
The DVR log displayes a paged grid containing all schedulded, current and completed
recordings. The list is sorted based on start time.
<p>
Use the bottom toolbar (not displayed in this manual) to navigate between pages
in the grid.
<img src="docresources/dvrlog.png">
<p>
To see more details about a recorded event, just click on it and a popup will appear:
<p>
<img src="docresources/dvrlogentry.png">
<p>
In this popup you can cancel a scheduled recording or abort a recording in progress.
To close the popup, just close it with the [X] window button.
<p>
Once the recording is completed there will be a clickable link to the recorded matroska
file so you can download it directly from the interface.
</div>
<div class="hts-doc-section">3.2 DVR Autorecorder</div>
<div class="hts-doc-text">
The 'Automatic Recorder' is used to create rules that will trig automatic recording of 
events. You can use this to record you favourite TV show(s), record all movies on
a specific channel, etc.
<p>
It's also possible to create a recording based on a query in the EPG. For more information
about that, please read the EPG chapter.
<p>
<img src="docresources/autorec.png">
<p>
 The tags are listed / edited  in a grid. 

 <ul>
  <li>To edit a cell, double click on it. After a cell is changed it
      will flags one of its corner to red to indicated that it has been
      changed. To commit these changes back to Tvheadend press the 
      'Save changes' button. In order to change a Checkbox cell you only
      have to click once in it.

  <li>To add a new entry, press the 'Add entry' button. The new (empty) entry
      will be created on the server but will not be in its enabled state.
      You can now change all the cells to the desired values, check the
      'enable' box and then press 'Save changes' to activate the new entry.

  <li>To delete one or more entries, select the lines (by clicking once on 
      them), and press the 'Delete selected' button. A popup

</div>
<div class="hts-doc-chapter">4 Configuration and administration</div>
<div class="hts-doc-text">

<p>
All configuration and administration of Tvheadend is conducted via the
built in web user interface.

<p>
To access the configuration tab (and its sub panels) you need Admin-access.
For details about access control, please see the 'Access-Control' section in this chapter.

<p>
Each subsystem of Tvheadend is configured via its own tab:

<p>
<img src="docresources/configtabs.png">

</div>
<div class="hts-doc-section">4.1 Access configuration</div>
<div class="hts-doc-text">

Setting upp access control is an important initial step as the system initially is
wide open.

<img src="docresources/accessconfig.png">

<p>
When Tvheadend verifies access is scan thru all the enabled access control entries.
The permission flags are combined for all matchin access entries.
An access entry is said to match if the username / password matches and the IP source
address of the requesting peer is within the prefix.
<p>

The access rules are listed / edited  in a grid. 

<ul>
 <li>To edit a cell, double click on it. After a cell is changed it
     will flags one of its corner to red to indicated that it has been
     changed. To commit these changes back to Tvheadend press the 
     'Save changes' button. In order to change a Checkbox cell you only
     have to click once in it.

 <li>To add a new entry, press the 'Add entry' button. The new (empty) entry
     will be created on the server but will not be in its enabled state.
     You can now change all the cells to the desired values, check the
     'enable' box and then press 'Save changes' to activate the new entry.

 <li>To delete one or more entries, select the lines (by clicking once on 
     them), and press the 'Delete selected' button. A popup
     will ask you to confirm your request.
</ul>

<p>
The columns have the following functions:

<dl>
 <dt>Enabled
 <dd>Make the entry participate in access control. If disabled, the entry
     is inactive.

  <dt>Username
  <dd>
  Name of user, if no username is needed for match it should contain a
  single asterix (*).

  <dt>Password
  <dd>
  Password to combine with user, if username is '*' (unused), the password
  should be the same.

  <dt>Prefix
  <dd>
  IPv4 prefix for matching based on source IP address.
  If set to 0.0.0.0/0 it will match everything.

  <dt>Streaming
  <dd>
  Enables access to streaming function. The 'streaming' access is enough to
  make Showtime (over HTSP) work.

  <dt>Video Recorder
  <dd>
  Enables access to all video recording functions. This also include administration
  of the auto recordings.

  <dt>Web interface
  <dd>
  Required for web user interface access. Also gives access to the EPG.

  <dt>Admin
  <dd>
  Enables access to the Configuration tab.

  <dt>Comment
  <dd>
  Allows the administrator to set a comment only visible in this editor.
  It does not serve any active purpose.
 </dl>

<p>
Let's also take a look at an example:
<p>
<img src="docresources/accessconfigexample.png">
<p>
First line gives clients orignating from 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.0.255 network
access to streaming functions. Typically you would use this for your
local media players at home (Allthough Showtime can prompt for username & password
in its HTSP client)
<p>
The second line adds a user with world wide access who might want to modify
recordings, etc, perhaps from the job, or mobile phone.
<p>
The third line provide admin access to the 'admin' user. As an extra precaution this
user is only allowed to log in from the home network.
<p>

</div>
<div class="hts-doc-section">4.2 Channel configuration</div>
<div class="hts-doc-text">

 <img src="docresources/channeltab.png">

 <div>
  The channel tab is divided in three parts:
  <dl>
   <dt>The channel list (to the left)
   <dd>Use this list to select the channel you wish to work with.
       You can also drag a channel from this list onto the right side of
       the view to merge the dragged channel with the currently selected one.

   <dt>Channel details (right top)

       <dl>
        <dt>Channel name
	<dd>Name of the channel as presented in EPG and external interfaces.
            Changing name of a channel does not interfere with scheduled
            recordings etc.

        <dt>XML-TV Source
        <dd>Name of the XML-TV channel. If you have XML-TV enabled you can 
            select which XML-TV channel to obtain data from. By default 
            Tvheadend tries to match the name itself, but sometimes it might
	    not match between the XML-TV source and the TV provider so in
	    such cases you can change it yourself.

        <dt>Tags
	<dd>Each channel can be bound to a zero, one or many tags.
	    The tags are used for multiple things and it's up to you how
	    you wish to use and name them. Tags can be used to aid searching
	    in the EPG if you have many channels. The tags are also presented
	    in the Showtime Media player.
	    To (de-)select multiple tags, just hold the CTRL-button as with
	    any multi-selection list.

        <dt>Delete channel
	<dd>This button will delete the channel (and any scheduled recordings
	    tied to it). You will be asked to confirm before the actual
	    delete is executed, but after that, there is no way to recover.
       </dl>
   <dd>Changes to any of these settings must be confirmed by pressing the
       'Save configuration' button before taking effect. If you select
       a different channel any unsaved changes will be lost. It is, however,
       perfectly fine to switch Tab (if you want to check anything, create
       a new tag, etc) and come back without any changes being lost.


   <dt>Transports bound to channel (right bottom)
   <dd>In this view you can examine and enable/disable each of the transports
       bound to the channel. You may wish to disable a transport if it
       temporary out of service or in other terms problematic.
       The status of the enable checkbox is saved when the 'Save configuration'
       button is pressed.

 <p>
 This tab is split in two panes. To the left is a tree which, at root level,
 contains all DVB adapters found by Tvheadend during startup.


 <dl>
  <dt>Step by step configuration of DVB
  <dd>
  The DVB configuration is perhaps the most tricky part to configure
  in Tvheadend. Therefore, this section begins with a step-by-step
  guide.
  <ul>
   <li>Click on an adapter in the left pane.
   <li>Click on 'Add mux(es)'. A popup window will appear:
   <br>
   <img src="docresources/muxbylocation.png">
   <br>
   For DVB-T and DVB-C adapters, expand appropriate country.
   DVB-S adapters only have one folder to expand called 'Geosynchronous Orbit'.
   In these folders you find a list of available networks.
   Select the appropriate network and press the 'Add' button.
   
   <li>
   Tvheadend will now immediately start to probe each mux for available
   services. Expand the DVB adapter in the tree 
   and wait until all muxes has been visisted
   at least once (Status of all multiplexes should change from 'Unknown' 
   when a mux has been visited).

   <li>
   You can now, if you want, verify that the mux scanner has found 
   services by expanding the mux nodes.

   <li>
   Select the adapters again and press 'Probe services'.
   A popup will ask you to confirm this action. Press 'Yes'.
   The Service probe will scan through all services on all muxes on the
   adapter and map them to channels with the corresponding name.
   Progress and result for each service is displayed in the 'System Log'
   at the bottom of the application. Wait until the probing is completed.
   <li>
   Done! You can click over to the 'Channels' configuration tab and 
   inspect all working channels.


  </ul>
  <dt>DVB Adapters
  <dd>
  A DVB adapter represents a piece of hardware attached to the system.
  DVB receivers with dual tuners will present themself as two adapters
  to the Tvheadend application. Tvheadend support DVB-T, DVB-C and DVB-S
  adapters.
  <p>
  When an adapter is selected, the right pane displays configurable items
  for the adapter. Also available in the right toolbar is a set of operations
  that can be performed on the adapter.
  <p>
  Underneath each adapter in the tree is a list of DVB muxes.
  For more information about muxes, see further down.
  <p>
  There is currently no way of adding a new adapter to Tvheadend when running.
  If a new adapter is plugged into the system Tvheadend needs to be restarted
  in order to detect it.
  <p>
  If Tvheadend has configuration for an adapter and the adapter is missing
  upon startup the configuration will be left untouched in case the adapter
  will be back in the future. There is currently no way to remove configuration
  for a no longer present adapter.
  <p>
  Warning: Unplugging an DVB adapter (USB, etc) during operation (i.e when
  Tvheadend is running) can result in deadlocking the kernel USB subsystem,
  most likely requiring a system restart.
  <p>
  Warning2: Suspending a system is (from a USB driver perspective) equivalent
  to a unplug/insert event. Thus, suspending a system running Tvheadend
  with USB adapters is not recommented at the moment.

  <dt>DVB Multiplexes
  <dd>
  To put it simply, a DVB multiplex is a digital signal modulated
  at a specific frequency that carries a number of servies (where a
  service could be, but is not limited to, a TV channel).
  <p>
  There are currently no operations that can be performed on a single mux.

  <dt>DVB Services
  <dd>
  A service is equivivalent to a TV channel.
  <p>
  There are currently no operations that can be performed on a single service.

 Tvheadend support connecting to card servers for so called softcam descrambling.

 <p>
 <img src="docresources/configcwc.png">

 <p>
 The servers are listed / edited  in a grid. 

 <ul>
  <li>To edit a cell, double click on it. After a cell is changed it
      will flags one of its corner to red to indicated that it has been
      changed. To commit these changes back to Tvheadend press the 
      'Save changes' button. In order to change a Checkbox cell you only
      have to click once in it.

  <li>To add a new entry, press the 'Add entry' button. The new (empty) entry
      will be created on the server but will not be in its enabled state.
      You can now change all the cells to the desired values, check the
      'enable' box and then press 'Save changes' to activate the new entry.

  <li>To delete one or more entries, select the lines (by clicking once on 
      them), and press the 'Delete selected' button. A popup
      will ask you to confirm your request.
 </ul>

 <p>
 The columns have the following functions:

 <dl>
  <dt>Enabled
  <dd>If selected, connection will be tried to be established and retained up.
      If unselected, Tvheadend will disconnect (if connected) and not try to reconnect.

  <dt>Hostname
  <dd>Server hostname. DNS lookup is performed upon every connection attempt.

  <dt>Port
  <dd>Server TCP port

  <dt>Username
